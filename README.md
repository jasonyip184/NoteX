## NoteX

This project is part of the module: Orbital (a.k.a., CP2106: Independent Software Development Project)
We are doing Apollo which is the most advanced level in this module.

NoteX uses Computer Vision and Speech Recognition to convert handwritten notes and voice recordings into text to be shared on multiple platforms straight from your smartphone. With NoteX, everyone will be able to take notes the way they want to and have the convenience of being able to easily convert their notes into digital format and share it securely.
